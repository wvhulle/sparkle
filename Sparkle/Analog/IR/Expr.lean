# Analog expression IR

The real-valued expression tree that analog device laws are built from, plus the
`Equation` value that pairs two expressions into an acausal relation.

This is the spine of the analog subsystem: device models reduce to `Equation`s
over `AExpr`, the solver stamps from it, the symbolic-differentiation pass walks
it, and (later) the verification layer reasons about it. It is deliberately
independent of `Sparkle.IR` — there are no bit widths here, only continuous reals.

Authoring ergonomics come from the arithmetic instances below: a device law such
as `i ≡ Is * (exp (v / Vt) - 1)` is ordinary Lean, where `*`, `/`, `-` and the
`exp` wrapper build `AExpr` nodes and `Float` parameters coerce in.

namespace Sparkle.Analog

/-- An unknown in the analog system: either the potential of a net (a node
voltage) or the flow through a branch (a branch current). Modified Nodal Analysis
solves for exactly these two kinds of unknown. Nets and branches are identified
by `Nat` handles assigned during circuit elaboration. -/
inductive Unknown where
  | netPotential (net : Nat)
  | branchFlow (branch : Nat)
  deriving Repr, BEq, DecidableEq, Inhabited

/-- Real-valued analog expression.

Exhaustive by design: the algebraic and transcendental fragment is what device
laws need, and the differential operator `ddt` is a first-class node because it
cannot be expressed as a pointwise scalar function — the transient engine rewrites
it into companion-model terms before numeric evaluation. -/
inductive AExpr where
  | lit (value : Float)
  | unknown (u : Unknown)
  /-- Absolute simulation time (`$abstime` in Verilog-A); lets sources be `time`-dependent. -/
